# UFOs
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with a dynamic table that provides in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The user can filter the data for multiple criteria at the same time, including date, city, state, country and shape. The final webpage is displayed below:

![UFOs](https://github.com/shayanafzal/UFOs/blob/03fd7aff624e7bd6062dadcf87aaa4bf064dd929/static/images/webpage.png)

## Result

The user can type in the search criteria that they are interested in and then hit the enter key to refresh the table.

## Summary
### One Drawback
1.	One of the drawbaks of this wepage is that it is not cell phone friendly. A number of people use their phone to perform quick web searches. The formatting of the webpage can be easily modified to make this cell phone frindly. The header images choosen for this page can also be replaced with one that is cell phone friendly. Doing so would increase the usbility of the data that is avalible as people interested in UFOs would be able to access the most current data on the go.

### Two Additional Recommendation for Further Development
1.	A button can be added to the page that will refresh the table back to its default state. Currently one has to refresh the page to do so. Doing so with make it easy to perform multiple searches and improve user experiance.
2.	A number of people are visual learners. Hence it would be beneficial to have charts and graphs that summarize the data that the users filter from the chart.
