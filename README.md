# UFOs
## Overview of Project
###Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with a dynamic table that provides in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The user can filter the data for multiple criteria at the same time, including date, city, state, country and shape.

## Result
### How to Perform a Search
The search filters are displayed on the left. User can filter the date using one or all of the parameter shown in the below image. 

The user can type in the search criteria that they are entered in and then hit enter to refresh the table.

## Summary
### One Drawback
1.	

### Two Additional Recommendation for Further Development
1.	A button can be added to the page that will refresh the table back to its default state. Currently one has to refresh the page to do so.
2.	A number of people are visual learners. Hence it would be beneficial to have charts and graphs that summarize the date that the users filter from the chart.
